# C# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the C# exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/), a platform designed to help developers improve their coding skills through practice and mentorship.

## About Exercism

[Exercism](https://exercism.org/) is a free and open-source platform that offers coding exercises in over 50 programming languages. It emphasizes learning through practice, providing feedback from mentors, and helping users deepen their understanding of programming concepts.

Each exercise on Exercism is designed to target specific language features or problem-solving techniques. By completing these exercises, I'm working to strengthen my knowledge of C# and write cleaner, more idiomatic code.
